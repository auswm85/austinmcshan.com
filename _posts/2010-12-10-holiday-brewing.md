As Christmas time approaches, I am looking forward to having some time  to develop my next brew. This year I don't think St. Nick will be  getting the usual cookies and milk, instead I'm going to opt for my  Santa Stout, a new winter stout I'll be getting started on shortly. In  the spirit of giving I'm going to give all you kiddies the recipe I'll  be using.

- 6 2/3 lbs Dark Malt Extract
- 2 lbs Dark DME
- 1 lb Crystal(60L)
- 1/2 lb Roasted Barley
- 1/2 lb Black Patent Malt
- 1 1/2 oz Cascade Hops (Bittering)
- 1/2 oz Hallertauer (Aroma)
- 6 oz Semisweet baking chocolate
- 4 oz Fresh mint leaves
- 1 package Irish Ale yeast

Slainte & Happy Holidays!
