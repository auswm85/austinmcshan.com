I recently came across a book [So Good They Can't Ignore You](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ "So Good They Can't Ignore You") by Cal Newport. This got me thinking about my perception of work and possible ways to improve it. 

In his book Newton attempts to explain how to derive happiness from your career. His view on attaining career happiness is that when deciding what career path to take one should consider doing something they are good at over the traditional path which is following something they are passionate about.

In this post I am going to try to expand and put my own twist on the how the Craftsman Theory in particular is a good mindset for a successful software engineer.

### Passion Theory
The passion theory goes as follows: find something you are passionate about and develop a career around it.

In his work "Passions of the Soul", Descarte seems to define passion as:
>A function of the mind body 
>union that can guide us in the pursuit of happiness.

Descarte's definition suggests that being passionate = being happy. I'm not saying that the passion theory is a "bad" or "wrong" example to follow, it just seems that often times being passionate about your work and being happy don't necessarily coexist. 

One flaw of the passion theory is that it assumes we know what we are passionate about in the first place. Often times one has to try several things before they find out what their truly passionate about.

### Craftsman Theory
The craftsman approach is about first gaining the necessary skill set to be great at whatever you are doing and the happiness will follow. By first being great at what you do, you're able to gain certain benefits and responsibilities that allow your career to be more fulfilling. A craftsman theorists would argue that passion is a side effect of mastery.

As a software engineer I appreciate what the craftsman theory has to offer for a couple of reasons.

Reason #1: The tech world is fast paced and you must accept that you'll need to continuously learn in order to stay abreast. If you don't accept this fact then you'll probably end up being left behind in the industry.

Reason #2: As a developer I like to think that what I am doing is a sort of craft, that I build refined and useful tools. The process also offers me a bit of creative release.

### Conclusion
I don't want to impose on any readers,I simply wanted to point out two popular paradigms for career happiness and development.

Whether you subscribe to the passion theory or the craftsman theory is irrelevant. What is relevant is that you apply whatever paradigm that allows you to be both happy and successful in your career and lives. Feel free to share your path to career happiness in the comments below.

Cheers!
