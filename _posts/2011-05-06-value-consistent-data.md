Data consistency quality is a valuable measure of whether a project will succeed or not. I think this statement is at the core of my development undertakings over the past few weeks.

Lately I've been running into a lot of issues where the underlying factors in being able to provide a feature or not depended on the data in the database. Seems as though over time the data management may have changed hands and the standards to which the data was held took a downturn. When this situation could be avoided by following a few simple rules.

It can be frustrating for a developer to go to his/her manager and say that an application can't be done because the data in the database is so skewed that it would ultimately be a waste of time to attempt to write application layer logic to present the information effectively.

As data volume increases, consistency of that data becomes extremely important, regardless of it's use (whether for internal or external purpose). Users deserve a consistent view of data for their consumption and if they don't have that then we as developers have ultimately failed in our goal. Organizations should spare nothing to keep end users happy and visiting their site.
