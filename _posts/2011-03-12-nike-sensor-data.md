I am finding it frustrating that there is no way to get run data directly off my Nike+ sensor without first syncing it with iTunes and thus having to try and use the horrible mess of a flash site that is nikeplus.com. &nbsp;It would be awesome if I could grab my runs straight off of the device and upload them to my online tool that would have some custom analytics that I could run(no pun intended) the data through in order to get a better idea of what my progress looks like.

From what I have read the only way to get close to doing this is to plug in my iPod into iTunes and export the data to the nikeplus site and use their public api to manipulate the data in my own way. This requires me to first off have an account with nikeplus, in addition to having an extra step in the process which seems to be an inefficient waste of time.

After all isn't the data technically mine anyway?
