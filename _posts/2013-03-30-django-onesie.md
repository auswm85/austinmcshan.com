One line commands are all the rage these days so I thought I'd take a crack at developing a full featured one liner for creating django projects. Enter [django onesie](https://gist.github.com/auswm85/5273748), a hearty one liner for starting off your django journey right. Django onesie uses [django-base-template](https://github.com/xenith/django-base-template) as a base template to put you right to work with all the tooling you should need for a robust django project. 

It's as simple as putting this code somewhere on your machine, adding it to your path or cd'ing into the directory you put the file and running the following command: `./django-onesie.sh mysupercoolproject`.
