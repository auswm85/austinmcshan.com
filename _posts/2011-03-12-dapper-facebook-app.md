Just woke up after what had been a long day/night of coding. I have spent the previous 24 hrs hacking away at the [UT Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=105307436194503 "UT Facebook Hackathon") where a buddy and I created a really killer application for iPhone & Android called [Dapper](http://apps.facebook.com/mydapper/ "Dapper")

The concept for Dapper is that you and other users have the ability to track real world interactions you may have with your Facebook friends. Hopefully in the near future everyone will be able to download the iPhone or Android application and by simply "bumping" your device with another Dapper user, the interaction will be recorded and displayed on each individuals Facebook stream. The aim of this is to essentially track what your "real" social circle is, eg. who do you really hang around.

In the future we look to continue adding additional functionality to make this an even more fun app for you and your friends to use.
